I am working on Quote application to demostrate usage of RXJava and Dagger. 
Sometimes it's bit confusing if we download big application which uses MVVM, Clean architecure, RxJava and Dagger. 
So, I am creating couple of version of the same application which will include these features steps by step.

If you want just want to add RxJava, you can refer https://github.com/yog16patel/androidrxjavademo.
